# Module-1-Functions-and-Errors

# Description

This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. The contract has a single function that returns the string "Hello World!". This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.

# Getting Started

To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.

Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., Jackelyb.sol). Copy and paste the following code into the file:

# Code Explaination

The require() function is used to validate inputs and conditions. If the condition is not met, the transaction is reverted, and any changes made to the state are undone. It is typically used to ensure that valid conditions are met before proceeding with the execution of the contract.

The assert() function is used to check for conditions that should never be false. It is intended for internal errors and to check invariants. If an assert statement fails, it means there is a bug in the contract.

The revert() function is used to trigger a manual error and revert the transaction. It is useful for situations where you want to conditionally revert the execution and provide a custom error message.
